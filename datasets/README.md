# üìö Datasets for Mini-Indig-LLM-Kit

This folder contains all training, evaluation, metadata, and vocabulary resources for building and adapting open-source language models for **Kanien‚Äôk√©ha** (Mohawk) and other low-resource polysynthetic Indigenous languages.

The structure and contents are designed to be **transparent, editable, and inclusive** of both technical and non-technical collaborators, and to support **offline use** on low-end hardware.
