# Polysynthetic Languages of the World

This document lists known or widely recognized **polysynthetic languages** and language families from **North and South America**. Note that not every individual language within a family is strictly polysynthetic, but many exhibit strong polysynthetic traits.

Polysynthetic languages are those that form complex words by combining many morphemes (meaningful units), often expressing what would be full sentences in other languages such as English, French, Spanish, German... North and South America are rich in polysynthetic languages, especially among Indigenous language families.

## ⚠️ Notes

- Polysynthesis exists on a **spectrum**.
- Some languages are more **synthetic or agglutinative**, but still exhibit key polysynthetic features.
- Many listed languages are **low-resource**, **endangered** or **extinct**, but included due to historical importance or documentation.
- Many of these languages are **severely under-documented** and lack sufficient **digital or academic resources**.
- Several have active or emerging **revitalization efforts** (e.g. Ainu, Tiwi, Bininj Kunwok).
- Polysynthesis varies in degree and structure; noun incorporation and verb complexity are common features.
- When working with low-resource language communities, it is your responsibility to actively **connect with, collaborate with, and create space and resources for recognized community leaders** to play meaningful leadership roles in your project. These leaders should be individuals who are already **respected and accepted within their communities**, specifically  those directly impacted by the language work you are engaging in.

If community leaders advise that you should not take a leadership or decision-making role in projects involving their language, culture, or community, it is important to respectfully honor their guidance. Clearly acknowledge that your work does not represent the community in any official capacity. Even if you are a community member or language speaker (or learner), it is best practice to clarify that your work reflects a personal perspective—not a singular or definitive voice of the community. This helps counter harmful generalizations that inaccurately portray Indigenous people as a single, homogenous identity shaped by colonial frameworks.

**Respect, consent, and community-led decision-making are non-negotiable.**
