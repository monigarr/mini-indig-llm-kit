# mini-indig-llm-kit 🪶

**An open-source starter kit to build, fine-tune, and deploy culturally responsible, offline-compatible Mini LLMs for Indigenous, polysynthetic, low-resource languages.**

---

## 🧠 What is This?

This toolkit helps Indigenous communities, researchers, and technologists fine-tune open-source LLMs like LLaMA 3 (8B) using QLoRA for their own languages—especially those without ISO codes, dictionaries, or digital resources.

All tools are optimized to run **offline**, with clear instructions, low-resource compatibility, and collaborative cultural protocols.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **Fine-tune LLaMA 3 with QLoRA** on your own corpus
- 🌐 **Train custom tokenizers** for polysynthetic languages
- 🛠️ **Use and deploy models offline** (USB sticks, old laptops, no internet)
- 📄 **Ethical templates and worksheets** for culturally safe collaboration
- 🧩 Modular Jupyter notebooks for tokenization, fine-tuning, inference
- 🔤 Prompt templates for translation, summarization, and chat
