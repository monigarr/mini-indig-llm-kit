ðŸ§  Notes for Use
All prompts follow a minimal schema:

Conversational: context + response

Summarization: input + target

Translation: input, output, source_language, target_language

These files are useful for:

Prompt tuning

Evaluation metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, etc.)

Few-shot training and alignment tuning

You can load them into datasets.load_dataset("json"), or parse manually in training scripts.
